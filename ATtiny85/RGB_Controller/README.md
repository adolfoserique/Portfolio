# PC Fan Controller with Integrated RGB LED Support

## Project Description
This project presents the design of a **PC fan controller** for fans that include their own **integrated RGB LED control**.  
The system manages fan operation while allowing the built‑in RGB lighting features to function normally.

The project also uses the **PC’s power supply** as the main source for all electronic components, ensuring compatibility with standard desktop hardware.
