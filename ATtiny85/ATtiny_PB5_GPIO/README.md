# ATtiny85 – PB5 Pin Reconfiguration

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how to reconfigure the **PB5** pin on the **ATtiny85**.  
By default, this pin functions as the microcontroller’s **reset** input, but it can be repurposed to work as an **additional GPIO**.

After this modification, the pin becomes available as a general‑purpose I/O, although it provides **lower current‑driving capability** compared to the other pins.
