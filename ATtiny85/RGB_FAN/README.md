# 12V RGB Controller Project

## Project Description
This project presents a **12V RGB lighting controller** designed for devices such as **PC fans that use a 12V RGB control connector**.  
The system allows full control of RGB lighting effects while remaining compatible with standard 12V RGB hardware.

Inside the `/src` directory, you can modify the firmware to add **custom color effects**, animations, or behavior tailored to your setup.
