# Arduino as ATtiny85 Programmer

## Project Description
This project provides a setup for using an **Arduino** as a programmer for the **ATtiny85**.  
Inside the `/src` directory, you will find both a **generic programmer** and a **custom programmer** specifically designed for the **Arduino Mega**.

These tools allow you to upload code to the ATtiny85 using different Arduino boards, offering flexibility depending on your hardware.
