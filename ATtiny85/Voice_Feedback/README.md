# Voice Repeater Toy Project

## Project Description
This project presents the design of a **voice repeater system** intended for use in a **children’s toy**.  
The system captures audio input, processes it, and plays it back to create an interactive and engaging sound experience for the user.

The implementation focuses on simplicity, reliability, and low‑power operation, making it suitable for embedded applications in small electronic toys.
