# Electronics Engineering Projects

This repository contains a collection of electronics engineering projects focused on hardware development, embedded systems, and hardware/software integration. The projects reflect hands-on experience with real hardware and practical engineering challenges.

## Overview

The main goal of this repository is to showcase practical engineering work involving:
- Embedded systems development
- Hardware and firmware integration
- PCB design and validation
- Debugging and testing on real hardware platforms

The projects here emphasize applied engineering rather than theoretical examples, with a strong focus on reliability, clarity, and real-world constraints.

## Technical Scope

The repository may include projects covering:
- Embedded C and C++ development
- Microcontrollers and embedded platforms
- Hardware/Software integration and debugging
- PCB schematic and layout design
- FPGA design using VHDL/Verilog
- Basic scripting for testing or automation (e.g. Python)

## Tools & Technologies

Depending on the project, the following tools and technologies may be used:
- Programming languages: C, C++, Python
- Embedded platforms: ARM-based microcontrollers
- PCB design tools: Altium Designer, KiCad
- Simulation tools: LTspice
- Version control: Git

## Project Structure

Each project typically contains:
- `src/` – Source code and firmware
- `hardware/` – Schematics, PCB layouts, and hardware-related files
- `docs/` – Technical notes, diagrams, or test reports
- `README.md` – Project-specific description and instructions

Not all projects follow the same structure, as this depends on their scope and objectives.
