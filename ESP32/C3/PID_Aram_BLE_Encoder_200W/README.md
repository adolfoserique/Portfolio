# Smart PID Heater for Aram Coffee Maker

## Project Description
This project presents the design of a **smart PID‑controlled heater** for the **Aram coffee maker**.  
The system uses a **200W cartridge heater** as the heat source to warm the water inside the machine, eliminating the need for manual pre‑heating.

## Operation
The device includes an **encoder** for temperature selection, a **solid‑state relay (SSR)** for heater control, a **thermometer** for temperature monitoring and stabilization, and an **OLED display** for real‑time visualization.

Temperature can also be selected using a **smartphone** via **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** communication. Additionally, the firmware supports **Over‑the‑Air (OTA)** updates, allowing wireless programming and maintenance.
